I - Change all the spaces in a string to "%20"
D - Replace the spaces in a given string with "%20" and return the modified string
1 - "The quick brown fox" -> "The%20quick%20brown%fox"
2 - Walk the string and everywhere there was a space, write a "%20" instead
3 - Traversing the string can be done with a for loop and determining if a character is a white space is a conditional
4 - ...
5 - ...
6 - "The quick" -> "The%20quick"
    "The  quick" -> "The%20%20quick"
    "The quick " -> ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
7 - The way I replace the space tries to put three characters where one character should be so if the space is at the end of the string it will go out of bounds
