I - Write a method that if an element in a given matrix is zero, sets its entire row and column to zero
D - Set a row and column in a matrix to zero if an element is zero, return the modified array
1 - 0 1 1    0 0 0
    1 1 1 -> 0 1 1
    1 1 1    0 1 1
2 - Traverse the array, if we see a zero set every element in the same row and column to zero
3 - Traversing the array can be done in nested loops and checking if an element is zero is conditional
4 - ...
5 - ...
6 - 1 1 1    1 1 0
    1 1 0 -> 0 0 0
    1 1 1    1 1 0
7 - Code did not fail
L - The method is pretty simple but having triply nested loops is terrible for runtime
