I - Determine if a string is the same itself with a substring moved
D - Determine if a subtring is in a concatenation of the original string
1 - "waterbottle","erbottlewat" -> true
2 - Concatnate the string with itself and check if the second string is in the concatenation, return a boolean
3 - Checking to see if the strings have the same length is the only condition that might be needed
4 - ...
5 - ...
6 - "gummyworm", "wormgummy" -> true
    "gummyworm", "gummyworm" -> true
7 - Code did not fail
L - Since the substring method is assumed to be given the only difficult part is seeing that you can check for rotations if the string is concatenated with itself
