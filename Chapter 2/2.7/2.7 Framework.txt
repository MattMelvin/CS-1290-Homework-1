I - Determine if two linked lists point to the same node at any point
D - Find any intersecting nodes between two lists and return the node
1 - "3 -> 1 -> 9", "5 -> 1 -> 8", "1"
2 - Walk the lists and determine if any two nodes have the same previous node
3 - Traversing the string is done in loop and checking previous nodes is done in conditionals
4 - ...
5 - ...
6 - "3 -> 1 -> 9", "5 -> 1 -> 8", "1"
7 - Since my implementation just checks for matching data due to a missassumption, it technically works but the way the problems was actually stated
L - I actually didn't this one the right way because I misread the problem, but if we assume the lists intersect at nodes that have the same data then my implementation works
