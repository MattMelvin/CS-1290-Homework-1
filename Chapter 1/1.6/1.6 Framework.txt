I - Write a method that compresses strings by counting repeated characters
D - Compress a string such that it is shorter than the origninal string, return a string
1 - "aabcccccaaa" -> "a2b1c5a3"
    "a" -> "a"
2 - Walk the string, whenever we see repeated character increment a count and whenever we see a new character reset the count, append the characters and counts together
3 - Traversing the string can be done in a for loop, determining if a character is a repeat is a conditional
4 - ...
5 - ...
6 - "aabcccccaaa" -> "a2b1c5a"
7 - Original implementation did not recognize a repeated character later in the string if had already been seen before
L - StringBuilders are very useful and HashSets are not actually always the solution to everything
