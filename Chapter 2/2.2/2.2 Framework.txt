I - Return the kth to last element in a linked list
D - Find the kth to last element and return that node (or its value)
1 - "1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6", "3" -> "4"
2 - Walk the list with one pointer until we reach the kth element (or the end), once reached walk first pointer and another pointer until first pointer reachres the end
3 - The first pointer can be handled with a for loop and conitional, the second makes more sense to use a while loop
4 - ...
5 - ...
6 - "1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5", "2" -> "4"
7 - I did not any edge cases but I'm pretty sure it worked for everything
L - If we could print the value rather than returning the node, this problem could have been solved in a single loop or through a few recursive calls
